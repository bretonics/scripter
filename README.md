Automate code template files; Perl, Ruby, Python, C

Need to write a Perl script? How about a Ruby, Python, or C file?

Scripter is an easy  to use utility that generates a template file for Perl, Ruby, Python, and C files. It automatically populates your new file with pre-defined text (you can alter to your likings and needs), setting you ready to actually start coding.

Scripter is perfect for new coders, as well as veteran programmers.

###Diminish Those Extra Keystrokes

Simply call scripter:
>$ scripter.pl myPerlFile.pl

In this example, the program will create a perl file named myPerlFile.pl in the current directory where it was run.

Best practice dictates adding the absolute path of scripter to your $PATH variable so you can call it at any location.
