Automate script template files: Perl, Ruby, Python, C

Need to write a Perl script? How about Ruby, Python, or C?

Scripter is an easy to use utility that generates a template file for Perl, Ruby, Python, and C files. It automatically populates with pre-defined text (you can alter to your likings and needs), setting you up and ready to actually start coding.

### Get Scripter
    git clone https://github.com/bretonics/scripter.git

#### Add To Path
Add scripter to your `$PATH` variable so you can call it from any location.

    cd scripter
    ln -s $PWD/scripter.pl /usr/local/bin/scripter

### Diminish Those Extra Keystrokes

Simply call scripter: `$ scripter myPerlFile.pl`

In this example, the program will create a perl file named myPerlFile.pl in the current directory where it was run.
